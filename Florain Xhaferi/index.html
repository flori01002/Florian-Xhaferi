        <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
       <b>
        I am a 15 year old boy in "11 Marsi School" of Prizren that studies the software dezign path. In the same time there are the questions: Why did i choose this path ? , Why did i want to study programming. And the asnwers are simple and clear, i like creating something new, something of your own where other people can watch it and have fun on it (Websites). Programming is a path where you have to be creative with it by buliding websites or games. It needs dedication. Im currently on the right track and i hope i dont get distracted by it. For right now as you can see i have a short biography/discription of my self, so i hape it gets bigger from my achievments in the future, as i will talk right now.

        <b>So the future has her things, like dreaming of something and planing something. As i said my dream is to be a future developer, but what i didnt mention is that i want to open a personal company. Where i can hire many other programmers. Opportunity, the meaning of which is simply the scopes that is available. And development opportunity is scope that is present to a person for the future development. Why a development is need to a person, of course for professional reason and that is the carrier. Carrere building is the first sector of development opportunity.

                <b>For the path,hobby you chose on a day to day life, it always starts from the inspiration.You get 
                    inspirated by someone
                    For my self i got inspirated by my cousin, he is lets call a mid developer that has a 5 year experience on programming.
                    At first i didn't understand what he was doing,i just saw words with diffrent colors and codes. So i was courious what is
                    it.
                    And he started giving me information about for what is it and the programming 
                    languages.
                    So i started studying it by myself and got to this point where i can say i know the basics of it.
